#Liskov substitution principle: LSP

#It is based on the concept of "substitutability" â€“ a principle in object-oriented programming stating that an object (such as a class) and a sub-object (such as a class that extends the first class) must be interchangeable without breaking the program

#Preconditions cannot be strengthened in the subtype.
#Postconditions cannot be weakened in the subtype.
#Invariants must be preserved in the subtype.
